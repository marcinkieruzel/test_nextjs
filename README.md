### TASK ###

- Mock api with command ```./node_modules/.bin/json-server ./db.json -i slug --watch```
- You'll see the list of products from one of our shops
- Create a page that includes a list of all products with pagination (10 products per page). Don't bother about styling – it suffice to use bootstrap or any simple styling
- Create a separate page for each product – use Incremental Static Regeneration Strategy and Dynamic Routes from Next.js
- Filter products on a front page based on ```product_cat```. In similar manner as this one: https://tinyurl.com/y9qu3fmd
